# Glosure
A programming language with lisp-like syntax written in MiniScript for the game Grey Hack.

This language was made to achieve the most features with the least code, as a Grey Hack hacktool.

You do not need to alter the code and it natively support everything for grey hack, so you do not need to code to do anything anymore, or actually you are just switched from greyscript to coding here.
